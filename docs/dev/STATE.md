# AXIOMM — development state

> **Read this file first if you are resuming AXIOMM development in a new

> See `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root for the working agreement and hard

> **About AXIOMM's scope.** AXIOMM is a Python package for spectroscopy.

## How development is organised

Work is split into **small, self-contained chunks**. Each chunk ends with:

1. The chunk's acceptance criteria verified locally (tests passing).
2. A clean git commit (no AI co-author trailer — see `CLAUDE.md`).
3. This file updated with the new state.
4. A hand back to Francesco.

Never start two chunks in one session without confirmation.

## Chunk plan

### Phase 0 — safe extraction (working end-to-end converter)

| # | Chunk                                                                | Status     |
|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1 | Skeleton + foundations (errors, models, protocols, handoff docs)     | ✅ done    |
| 2 | `discover_inputs` (§6) + unit tests                                  | ✅ done    |
| 3 | `XRMMapH5Reader` (§7) + synthetic HDF5 fixture (§20.1) + tests       | ✅ done    |
| 4 | `HyperSpyBuilder` (§8) + axis-order tests                            | ⬜ next    |
| 5 | `HSpyWriter` (§9.4) + `convert_file` (§11.2) + end-to-end test       | ⬜ pending |

### Phase 1 — usability

| # | Chunk                                                                | Status     |
|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 6 | CLI `axiomm-convert` (§10.4) + `convert_many` + CLI tests            | ⬜ pending |
| 7 | Manifest writer (§9.5) + logging (§14) + provenance metadata (§15)   | ⬜ pending |
| 8 | Optional Tk dialogs (§10.5) + notebook helpers (§10.6)               | ⬜ pending |

### Phase 2 / 3 — configurability and extensibility

Tracked in spec §23. Pick up after Phase 1 lands.

## Current state (as of Chunk 3)

What exists in this repository:

* Package skeleton under `src/axiomm/io/converters/` with sub-packages for
  `readers/`, `signals/`, `writers/`.
* `errors.py` — full exception hierarchy from spec §13.
* `models.py` — `AxisSpec`, `Diagnostic`, `SourceProvenance`,
  `AxiommSignalPayload`, `ConversionResult` plus the `AxisRole`,
  `SignalKind`, `Severity` type aliases (spec §8.3, §9.6).
* `readers/base.py`, `signals/base.py`, `writers/base.py` — runtime-checkable
  `Protocol`s for `Reader`, `SignalBuilder`, `Writer`. Generality is built in
  from the start: HyperSpy is one possible builder, not an assumption.
* **`discovery.py` — `discover_inputs(...)`** implementing spec §6: file or
  directory input, optional extension filter (case-insensitive), optional
  sample-substring filter on file names, optional recursion, deterministic
  ordering, `InputDiscoveryError` on missing path / non-file-non-dir input
  / no matches with `require_non_empty=True`. Pure pathlib, no HDF5, no GUI.
* `tests/io/converters/test_import_has_no_side_effects.py` — guards spec
  §24.1 (silent import) plus a "models stay backend-neutral" check.
* **`tests/io/converters/test_discovery.py`** — 18 tests covering every
  spec §6 behavioural requirement plus determinism and a "no h5py / no
  tkinter import" check specific to `discover_inputs`.
* **`readers/xrmmap_h5.py` — first concrete reader.** `XRMMapH5Reader`
  implements the `Reader` protocol; every HDF5 path is a field of the
  frozen `XRMMapH5Config` (spec §7.5) so XRM-style files with different
  paths can be read by passing a configured reader. Missing optional
  metadata becomes structured `Diagnostic`s on the payload; only a
  missing primary counts dataset raises (`DatasetNotFoundError`, with an
  actionable message naming the path and the config field to override).
  Includes spec §7.6 string-decoding helpers (`decode_hdf5_string`,
  `decode_hdf5_string_array`) and the spec §7.7 beam-size parser
  (`parse_micrometre_value`). MVP reads eagerly; `lazy=True` is accepted
  and produces a `lazy_downgraded_to_eager` diagnostic.
* **`tests/io/converters/conftest.py`** — `synthetic_xrmmap_h5` factory
  fixture (spec §20.1): builds minimal valid XRM-map HDF5 files in
  `tmp_path` with switches to omit each dataset group so the reader's
  missing-metadata branches can be exercised.
* **`tests/io/converters/test_xrmmap_h5_reader.py`** — 59 tests covering
  `XRMMapH5Config` defaults (spec §17), the protocol attributes,
  `can_read` (extension + signature peek), happy-path `read`, every
  missing-metadata branch, the `lazy` flag, the config-override
  "different paths" use case, and an `import` hygiene check.
* `axiomm.io.converters.__init__` re-exports `XRMMapH5Reader` and
  `XRMMapH5Config` lazily via PEP 562 `__getattr__`, so package import
  still does not pull in `h5py`.
* `pyproject.toml` with src-layout, `requires-python = ">=3.10"`, optional
  extras for `hdf5`, `hyperspy`, `all`, `notebook`, `dev`. Pytest configured
  with `pythonpath = ["src"]` so tests run without an install.
* `LICENSE` — PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.
* `README.md` — short package summary (with AXIOMM acronym expansion),
  Tools section, dev install, wiki link, licence note.
* `CLAUDE.md` at repo root — hard constraints and working agreement;
  spells out the AXIOMM acronym and warns the M's are *Mineral Mapping*,
  not Microscopy.
* `docs/specs/converter_tool_spec.md` — the authoritative spec (copy of the
  original from `docs_refactoring/`).
* `docs/specs/_legacy/converter_prototype.py` — the original converter
  prototype, reference-only. **Do not import or extend it from package code.**
* `.gitignore` tuned for Python + scientific scratch outputs.
* Public wiki at <https://github.com/FrancescoPerrone/axiomm/wiki>
  (Home, Tools, Converter, Converter-Architecture, Roadmap, Development,
  Specification, Glossary, plus `_Sidebar` / `_Footer`).

What does **not** yet exist (deferred to later chunks):

* Any concrete signal builder, writer, or workflow function.
* The `workflows.py` and `registry.py` modules.
* The CLI entry point (commented out in `pyproject.toml`).
* The `ux/` subpackage (CLI, notebook, Tk dialogs).
* User-facing documentation under `docs/user/`.
* `CITATION.cff` and `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`.

### Real-file findings from Chunk 3 (recorded for later chunks)

The reader was smoke-tested against the smallest real XRM file at
`/home/francesco/Desktop/research/melts/data/Maps-HDF5/IE_30s_map__Sep16_15_20_39_A22-043_1_001.h5`
(not in the repo). Findings:

- **Counts shape** `(23, 21, 4096)` — `(xdim, ydim, n_channels)`. Reads
  cleanly; `energy_scale = 40.96 / 4096 = 0.01` keV/channel gives a
  reasonable 40.96 keV span.
- **Beam size** `"2um"` was parsed correctly → navigation scale 2.0 µm.
- **65 environ entries** were extracted without issue.
- **ROI limits shape** is `(35, 7, 2)`, *not* `(n_rois, 2)`. The real
  file stores multiple ROI variants per element (likely per-detector
  or per-fit-pass). The reader currently emits the
  `roi_limits_unexpected_shape` diagnostic and skips ROI extraction — a
  safe MVP behaviour but a real schema-conformance issue. To recover
  ROI metadata from real files, one of:
  1. Add a `roi_variant_index: int = 0` (or similar) to
     `XRMMapH5Config` in Phase 2 and use `limits[:, roi_variant_index, :]`.
  2. Use the generic HDF5 schema-driven reader (Phase 3, spec §23).

## Next chunk: Chunk 4 — `HyperSpyBuilder` + axis-order tests

**Goal.** Implement spec §8 in full: the first concrete `SignalBuilder`,
which turns an `AxiommSignalPayload` into a HyperSpy signal. Resolve the
`signal_kind` deterministically, validate axes against the data shape
*before* building, and handle HyperSpy's reversed axis convention
correctly (spec §8.7 explicitly warns the builder must validate this).

**New files (expected):**

* `src/axiomm/io/converters/signals/hyperspy_builder.py` —
  `HyperSpyBuilder` class implementing `SignalBuilder`, plus the
  convenience function `build_hyperspy_signal(payload)`.
* `src/axiomm/io/converters/signals/validation.py` — `validate_axes(...)`
  helper used by the builder (spec §8.6).
* `tests/io/converters/test_hyperspy_builder.py` — tests covering:
  - signal-kind resolution (`signal1d`, `signal2d`, `auto`, `base`);
  - axis count vs. `data.ndim`;
  - axis sizes vs. data shape;
  - axis name/units/scale/offset propagation;
  - **HyperSpy axis-order correctness** — given a payload with
    `AxisSpec.index_in_array=(0=x, 1=y, 2=Energy)`, the resulting
    HyperSpy `axes_manager` must label the axes correctly *despite*
    HyperSpy reversing navigation-axis order relative to numpy;
  - metadata namespacing under `signal.metadata.AXIOMM`;
  - real-file round-trip with `XRMMapH5Reader → HyperSpyBuilder` on
    the smallest local XRM file
    (`IE_30s_map__Sep16_15_20_39_A22-043_1_001.h5`).

**Acceptance criteria for Chunk 4:**

1. `HyperSpyBuilder().build(payload)` returns a `hs.signals.Signal1D`
   for `signal_kind="signal1d"`, `Signal2D` for `"signal2d"`,
   `BaseSignal` for `"base"`, and auto-infers from the count of signal
   axes when `signal_kind="auto"`.
2. Axis validation raises `SignalValidationError` when:
   - the number of `AxisSpec` entries does not match `data.ndim`;
   - any axis size does not match the corresponding data dimension;
   - the number of signal axes is wrong for the chosen signal kind.
3. Axis names, units, scales, and offsets propagate correctly into
   the HyperSpy `axes_manager`, with the navigation/signal split
   determined by `AxisSpec.role` and the array-order mapping driven by
   `AxisSpec.index_in_array` (not by tuple position).
4. `payload.metadata`, `payload.original_metadata`, `payload.title`,
   `payload.provenance`, and `payload.diagnostics` are all preserved on
   the resulting signal under a stable `signal.metadata.AXIOMM`
   namespace.
5. End-to-end test against the local real XRM file produces a
   `Signal1D` whose `axes_manager` has the expected x / y / Energy
   axes in the correct positions (this is the test that catches the
   prototype's axis-labelling bug).
6. Importing `axiomm.io.converters.signals.hyperspy_builder` does not
   pull in tkinter; all earlier side-effect tests still pass.
7. Tests are skipped cleanly with `pytest.importorskip("hyperspy")` when
   HyperSpy is not installed.
8. `pytest` is green overall.

**Out of scope for Chunk 4.**

* No writer (Chunk 5).
* No workflow orchestration (Chunk 5).
* No registry (Phase 1+).
* No alternative builder backends (xarray, RosettaSciIO, etc.) — the
  `SignalBuilder` protocol is already in place; new builders ship as
  separate chunks when needed.

**Dependency note.** Chunk 4 introduces `hyperspy` as a real runtime
dependency. Install with `pip install -e ".[dev,hyperspy]"` (or `[all]`).
HyperSpy's reversed axis convention vs. numpy is the *single biggest
risk* in this chunk — invest the time to assert axis labels and sizes
explicitly against the constructed `axes_manager`, not just against the
payload's `AxisSpec` tuple.

## Verifying the current state (after Chunk 3)

In an environment with Python ≥ 3.10 and the dev extras installed, the
canonical chunk-verification commands are:

```bash
cd /home/francesco/Desktop/research/axiomm
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,hdf5]"
pytest -q
```

Expected result: **82 tests pass**, 0 fail. (If `h5py` is not installed
the 59 XRM reader tests are skipped, but the remaining 23 still pass.)

If the system pytest (`/usr/bin/pytest`, Python 3.11) is used without
installing the package, the `[tool.pytest.ini_options].pythonpath = ["src"]`
entry in `pyproject.toml` is enough — `pytest -q` from the repo root still
works.

## Open decisions

* **Licence (decided in Chunk 1).** PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 was chosen
  because Francesco said: "we do not want to release it completely free just
  now". Researchers and academic institutions can use AXIOMM freely;
  commercial users need a separate licence from Francesco. The licence is
  easy to change later (re-licensing a project still owned by a single author
  is straightforward) — if Francesco prefers a different model (BUSL,
  source-available custom, "all rights reserved"), it can swap in one
  commit. Document any change in this file and update `LICENSE` and
  `README.md` in lockstep.
* **Repository hosting.** Local-only for now. When the package is ready to
  be published, Francesco will create the GitHub repository himself and
  push from his account.
* **Package name `axiomm`.** Not yet checked against PyPI. Verify before any
  publication attempt — if taken, decide an alternative early (e.g.
  `axiomm-tools`, `pyaxiomm`) and update `pyproject.toml`,
  `README.md`, and the import root.
* **`axiomm.io` namespace.** Reserved for I/O subpackages (`converters/`
  today, possibly `formats/`, `streaming/` later). Don't put non-I/O code in
  `axiomm.io`. The broader AXIOMM analysis pipeline will live in sibling
  packages (`axiomm.signal`, `axiomm.analysis`, …) — names TBD with
  Francesco when scope expands beyond the converter.
* **Documentation tooling.** Initial choice is the **GitHub wiki**, seeded
  with `Home`, `Tools`, `Converter`, `Converter-Architecture`, `Roadmap`,
  `Development`, `Specification`, `Glossary` plus `_Sidebar` / `_Footer`.
  Live at <https://github.com/FrancescoPerrone/axiomm/wiki>. Wiki pages
  live in a separate git repo (`axiomm.wiki.git`) and must be edited there,
  not in `docs/`. Heavier tooling (Sphinx / MkDocs with API autodoc) is
  still on the table for later, once the public API stabilises.

## Notes for resuming work

* If `pyproject.toml` was edited to add the CLI entry point earlier than
  Chunk 6, revert — the chunk plan keeps things working in order.
* The synthetic HDF5 fixture in Chunk 3 should live at
  `tests/io/converters/fixtures.py` and produce a `(4, 3, 16)` array per
  spec §20.1.
* When implementing Chunk 4 (HyperSpy builder), use the real
  `IE_30s_map__Sep16_15_20_39_A22-043_1_001.h5` at
  `/home/francesco/Desktop/research/melts/data/Maps-HDF5/` (≈ 950 KB,
  smallest available) to verify axis order matches the prototype's output.
  Do **not** commit that file or any other real `.h5` to the repo.
