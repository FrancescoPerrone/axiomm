## How development is organised

Work is split into **small, self-contained chunks**. Each chunk ends with:

1. The chunk's acceptance criteria verified locally (tests passing).
2. A clean git commit (no AI co-author trailer — see `CLAUDE.md`).
3. This file updated with the new state.
4. A hand back to Francesco.

Never start two chunks in one session without confirmation.

## Chunk plan

### Phase 0 — safe extraction (working end-to-end converter)

| # | Chunk                                                                | Status     |
|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1 | Skeleton + foundations (errors, models, protocols, handoff docs)     | ✅ done    |
| 2 | `discover_inputs` (§6) + unit tests                                  | ✅ done    |
| 3 | `XRMMapH5Reader` (§7) + synthetic HDF5 fixture (§20.1) + tests       | ✅ done    |
| 4 | `HyperSpyBuilder` (§8) + axis-order tests                            | ✅ done    |
| 5 | `HSpyWriter` (§9.4) + `convert_file` (§11.2) + end-to-end test       | ✅ done    |

**Phase 0 complete.** The converter has a working Python end-to-end API:
`from axiomm.io.converters import convert_file` accepts an XRM-style
`.h5` and produces an `.hspy` with correctly-labelled axes, AXIOMM
metadata namespace, and structured diagnostics. Verified against the
synthetic fixture and against the real
`IE_30s_map__Sep16_15_20_39_A22-043_1_001.h5` test file.

### Phase 1 — usability

| # | Chunk                                                                | Status     |
|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 6 | CLI `axiomm-convert` (§10.4) + `convert_many` + CLI tests            | ⛔ blocked* |
| 7 | Manifest writer (§9.5) + logging (§14) + provenance metadata (§15)   | ✅ done     |
| 8 | Optional Tk dialogs (§10.5) + notebook helpers (§10.6)               | ⛔ blocked* |

\* Chunks 6 and 8 are blocked on the **UX-layout decision** — see
"Open decisions" below. Chunk 7 (manifest + logging + provenance) does
not touch UX and can proceed without it; reorder Phase 1 accordingly
when the time comes.

### Phase 2 — configurability and validation (spec §23)

| # | Chunk                                                                | Status     |
|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 9 | Stricter axis validation + `roi_variant_index` for real XRM files    | ✅ done    |
| 10 | Restructure `payload.metadata["AXIOMM"]` per spec §15 nested layout | ✅ done    |
| 11 | Real-file e2e regression fixture + scientific-constant justification | ✅ done    |

**Phase 2 complete.** The converter now validates axes strictly, exposes
the ROI-variant choice, uses the nested AXIOMM metadata layout from
spec §15, ships a manifest schema (v2) that mirrors it, and carries
realistic-shape regression coverage. Three scientific constants remain
flagged as open assumptions (`energy_scale`, `roi_limit_scale`,
`fallback_field_width_um`) — see the user guide for what needs domain
confirmation before public release.

### Phase 3 — extensibility (spec §23)

| #  | Chunk                                                              | Status     |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 12 | Reader/writer registry (no plugin discovery yet)                   | ✅ done    |
| 13 | Plugin discovery via Python entry points                           | ✅ done    |
| 14 | Generic HDF5 schema-driven reader prototype                        | ✅ done    |
| 15 | Additional output writers (only when scientifically justified)     | ⬜ pending |

## Current state (as of Chunk 14 — Phase 3.3: generic HDF5 reader)

What exists in this repository:

* Package skeleton under `src/axiomm/io/converters/` with sub-packages for
  `readers/`, `signals/`, `writers/`.
* `errors.py` — full exception hierarchy from spec §13.
* `models.py` — `AxisSpec`, `Diagnostic`, `SourceProvenance`,
  `AxiommSignalPayload`, `ConversionResult` plus the `AxisRole`,
  `SignalKind`, `Severity` type aliases (spec §8.3, §9.6).
* `readers/base.py`, `signals/base.py`, `writers/base.py` — runtime-checkable
  `Protocol`s for `Reader`, `SignalBuilder`, `Writer`. Generality is built in
  from the start: HyperSpy is one possible builder, not an assumption.
* **`discovery.py` — `discover_inputs(...)`** implementing spec §6: file or
  directory input, optional extension filter (case-insensitive), optional
  sample-substring filter on file names, optional recursion, deterministic
  ordering, `InputDiscoveryError` on missing path / non-file-non-dir input
  / no matches with `require_non_empty=True`. Pure pathlib, no HDF5, no GUI.
* `tests/io/converters/test_import_has_no_side_effects.py` — guards spec
  §24.1 (silent import) plus a "models stay backend-neutral" check.
* **`tests/io/converters/test_discovery.py`** — 18 tests covering every
  spec §6 behavioural requirement plus determinism and a "no h5py / no
  tkinter import" check specific to `discover_inputs`.
* **`readers/xrmmap_h5.py` — first concrete reader.** `XRMMapH5Reader`
  implements the `Reader` protocol; every HDF5 path is a field of the
  frozen `XRMMapH5Config` (spec §7.5) so XRM-style files with different
  paths can be read by passing a configured reader. Missing optional
  metadata becomes structured `Diagnostic`s on the payload; only a
  missing primary counts dataset raises (`DatasetNotFoundError`, with an
  actionable message naming the path and the config field to override).
  Includes spec §7.6 string-decoding helpers (`decode_hdf5_string`,
  `decode_hdf5_string_array`) and the spec §7.7 beam-size parser
  (`parse_micrometre_value`). MVP reads eagerly; `lazy=True` is accepted
  and produces a `lazy_downgraded_to_eager` diagnostic.
* **`tests/io/converters/conftest.py`** — `synthetic_xrmmap_h5` factory
  fixture (spec §20.1): builds minimal valid XRM-map HDF5 files in
  `tmp_path` with switches to omit each dataset group so the reader's
  missing-metadata branches can be exercised.
* **`tests/io/converters/test_xrmmap_h5_reader.py`** — 59 tests covering
  `XRMMapH5Config` defaults (spec §17), the protocol attributes,
  `can_read` (extension + signature peek), happy-path `read`, every
  missing-metadata branch, the `lazy` flag, the config-override
  "different paths" use case, and an `import` hygiene check.
* `axiomm.io.converters.__init__` re-exports `XRMMapH5Reader` and
  `XRMMapH5Config` lazily via PEP 562 `__getattr__`, so package import
  still does not pull in `h5py`.
* **`signals/validation.py` — `validate_axes`**: structural-then-semantic
  checks per spec §8.6 (axis count vs. `data.ndim`; every axis declares
  a valid in-bounds `index_in_array`; the indices form a complete
  permutation of `[0, ndim)`; axis sizes match the data shape;
  signal-axis count matches the requested `SignalKind`). Eagerly
  re-exported from the converters package — it has no heavy deps.
* **`signals/hyperspy_builder.py` — first concrete `SignalBuilder`.**
  `HyperSpyBuilder.build(payload)` validates the payload, resolves
  `signal_kind="auto"` from the count of signal axes, optionally
  transposes the data so signal axes are trailing (HyperSpy's
  expectation), constructs the right `hs.signals.*` class, and assigns
  axis name/units/scale/offset by matching `AxisSpec.index_in_array` to
  HyperSpy's `axis.index_in_array` — *not* by tuple position, which is
  how the prototype's axis-labelling bug came in (HyperSpy reverses
  `navigation_axes` order relative to numpy). Metadata is copied into
  `signal.metadata.AXIOMM`, including provenance and diagnostics;
  `payload.title` becomes `signal.metadata.General.title`;
  `payload.original_metadata` carries over verbatim.
  `build_hyperspy_signal(payload)` is a convenience wrapper.
  Lazily re-exported from the converters package via `__getattr__`.
* **`tests/io/converters/test_hyperspy_builder.py`** — 26 tests covering
  signal-kind resolution (signal1d/signal2d/base/auto), every
  `validate_axes` failure mode, axis-name correctness (the test that
  catches the prototype bug), non-canonical axis order (signal axis at
  numpy index 0 → transparently transposed), every metadata-propagation
  branch, the convenience function, an end-to-end synthetic-fixture
  round trip, and the no-tkinter-on-import check. Module-level
  `pytest.importorskip("hyperspy.api")` so the suite still passes
  cleanly in environments without HyperSpy.
* **`writers/hspy.py` — first concrete writer.** `HSpyWriter` writes a
  HyperSpy signal to disk via `signal.save(...)`. Enforces the AXIOMM
  safety rule: by default an existing target raises
  `OutputExistsError` (the error message names the path and the flag to
  pass for replacement); `overwrite=True` replaces. Creates parent
  directories automatically.
* **`workflows.py` — `convert_file`.** End-to-end orchestrator: resolves
  a reader (instance, registered name, or `"auto"` via `can_read`
  dispatch), reads, builds the HyperSpy signal, writes the output, and
  returns a `ConversionResult`. Output-path resolution per spec §11.2:
  explicit `output_path` wins → otherwise `output_dir/<stem>.<ext>` →
  otherwise `input_path.with_suffix(default_ext)`. `skip_existing=True`
  short-circuits before reading and emits a diagnostic; `manifest=True`
  is accepted for forward compatibility but emits a
  `manifest_not_yet_implemented` diagnostic until Chunk 7 lands. A tiny
  built-in `_BUILTIN_READERS` / `_BUILTIN_WRITERS` mapping handles
  string-name dispatch without depending on the full registry (Phase 3).
* `axiomm.io.converters.__init__` now eagerly re-exports `convert_file`
  alongside `validate_axes`, and lazily exposes `HSpyWriter` via the
  PEP 562 `__getattr__`. Package import still does not pull in `h5py`,
  `hyperspy`, or `tkinter`.
* **`tests/io/converters/test_hspy_writer.py`** — 10 tests covering
  protocol attributes, write happy path, parent-directory creation,
  round-trip metadata preservation, the overwrite policy (refuses by
  default, replaces with `overwrite=True`), the actionable error
  message, and import hygiene.
* **`tests/io/converters/test_workflows.py`** — 22 tests covering the
  happy path end-to-end (synthetic-fixture round trip producing a
  loadable `.hspy`), the axis-labels-end-to-end guard against the
  prototype's x/y swap, every output-path resolution rule, reader
  dispatch (named, `auto`, instance, unknown, multiple, none),
  writer dispatch (named, instance, unknown), the overwrite policy at
  workflow level, `skip_existing` behaviour, the manifest diagnostic,
  top-level import path, and import hygiene.
* The `test_import_has_no_side_effects.py` "no side effects" tests now
  run in **subprocesses** for true isolation, because earlier in-process
  module-drop patterns broke class identity for `OutputExistsError` and
  friends once enough downstream code held references to them.
* **`writers/manifest.py` — manifest writer + builder** (spec §9.5).
  `ManifestWriter` serialises a manifest dict to a JSON sidecar at
  `<output>.axiomm.json`. `build_manifest_dict(...)` composes the
  manifest from a payload; `extract_reader_config(reader)` pulls a
  reader's dataclass config into a JSON-friendly dict (generic over
  any reader with a dataclass `.config`). The manifest schema carries
  a `manifest_schema_version` (`"1"` today), `axiomm_version`,
  `created_at` (ISO 8601 UTC), `input_path`, `output_path`,
  `reader_name`, `writer_name`, `source_shape`, `axes_summary`,
  `diagnostics`, `config_used`, and the three-bucket
  `provenance_classification`.
* **`readers/xrmmap_h5.py` — provenance classification** (spec §15).
  The reader now populates `payload.metadata["AXIOMM"]["provenance_classification"]`
  with three buckets:
  - **observed**: counts dataset, environ table, ROI table when
    present; navigation scale when it came from the beam-size key.
  - **inferred**: all three axis sizes (derived from `data.shape`).
  - **assumed**: Energy axis scale + units (config defaults with no
    file source), navigation axis units, navigation scale when it
    came from `fallback_field_width_um / xdim`, ROI start/end values
    (since `roi_limit_scale` is applied).
  The classification flows through the existing `HyperSpyBuilder`
  metadata copy without modification (it sits inside the AXIOMM
  namespace dict that the builder already preserves).
* **`workflows.py` — `convert_file` now writes the manifest.** When
  `manifest=True` (the default), the workflow assembles a manifest
  via `build_manifest_dict(...)` and writes it to
  `manifest_path_for(written_path)`. `ConversionResult.manifest_path`
  is set accordingly; `manifest=False` keeps it `None`. The old
  `manifest_not_yet_implemented` diagnostic is removed.
* **Logging (spec §14).** Each module now has
  `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` and emits a single `INFO`
  message at the entry point (`discover_inputs`, `XRMMapH5Reader.read`,
  `HyperSpyBuilder.build`, `HSpyWriter.write`, `ManifestWriter.write`,
  `convert_file`). No `print(...)` calls anywhere in the converter
  package; Python's default `WARNING` level keeps the package quiet by
  default but lets users opt into AXIOMM logs with one
  `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` call.
* **Tests added:**
  - `tests/io/converters/test_manifest_writer.py` — 21 tests covering
    `MANIFEST_SUFFIX` / schema version constants, `manifest_path_for`,
    every field `build_manifest_dict` must populate, the three-bucket
    `provenance_classification` defaulting when a reader doesn't
    classify, the `extract_reader_config` dataclass-aware helper,
    `ManifestWriter` happy-path / overwrite-policy / sorted-keys
    diff-friendliness, and the import-hygiene check.
  - `tests/io/converters/test_workflows.py` — flipped the two former
    "manifest_not_yet_implemented" tests to verify the new
    write-sidecar behaviour; added tests asserting the manifest
    contains every required field, that the manifest's path follows
    the `<output>.axiomm.json` convention with the full output name
    preserved, and that reader diagnostics carry through into the
    manifest.
  - `tests/io/converters/test_xrmmap_h5_reader.py` — 6 new tests on
    the three-bucket classification: structure, observed includes
    counts + environ, inferred includes axis sizes, assumed includes
    Energy scale + units, the beam-size vs. fallback path for nav
    scale classification.
* **`signals/validation.py` — stricter `validate_axes` checks (Chunk 9).**
  Per-axis leaf-level integrity: every `AxisSpec.name` must be a
  non-empty string, `size` must be a positive int, `scale` (if not
  `None`) must be finite, `offset` must be finite. Cross-axis: names
  within each role group (navigation / signal) must be unique
  (HyperSpy's `axes_manager` looks axes up by name; duplicates are
  silently lossy). Existing checks unchanged.
* **`readers/xrmmap_h5.py` — ROI variant extraction (Chunk 9).**
  `XRMMapH5Config` gained `roi_variant_index: int = 0`. The reader
  now detects 3-D ROI limits arrays of shape
  `(n_rois, n_variants, 2)` (the real-file shape) and slices
  `limits[:, roi_variant_index, :]` — turning the previous
  `roi_limits_unexpected_shape` warning into a configurable extraction.
  Out-of-bounds `roi_variant_index` emits a new
  `roi_variant_out_of_bounds` warning and skips extraction with a
  message naming the available range. The 2-D `(n_rois, 2)` path
  stays working as a regression.
* **`tests/io/converters/conftest.py`** — synthetic fixture gained a
  `roi_limits_override: np.ndarray | None` parameter so tests can
  write any-shape ROI limits arrays.
* **`tests/io/converters/test_hyperspy_builder.py`** — 6 new tests
  on the stricter validation: empty name, non-positive size, NaN
  scale, inf offset, duplicate navigation names, duplicate signal
  names.
* **`tests/io/converters/test_xrmmap_h5_reader.py`** — 5 new tests
  on ROI variant handling: default `roi_variant_index=0` on a
  `(2, 7, 2)` fixture; non-default variant index extracting that
  slice; out-of-bounds index emitting the diagnostic; 2-D regression.
* `pyproject.toml` with src-layout, `requires-python = ">=3.10"`, optional
  extras for `hdf5`, `hyperspy`, `all`, `notebook`, `dev`. Pytest configured
  with `pythonpath = ["src"]` so tests run without an install.
* `LICENSE` — PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.
* `README.md` — short package summary (with AXIOMM acronym expansion),
  Tools section, dev install, wiki link, licence note.
* `CLAUDE.md` at repo root — hard constraints and working agreement;
  spells out the AXIOMM acronym and warns the M's are *Mineral Mapping*,
  not Microscopy.
* `docs/specs/converter_tool_spec.md` — the authoritative spec (copy of the
  original from `docs_refactoring/`).
* `docs/specs/_legacy/converter_prototype.py` — the original converter
  prototype, reference-only. **Do not import or extend it from package code.**
* `.gitignore` tuned for Python + scientific scratch outputs.
* Public wiki at <https://github.com/FrancescoPerrone/axiomm/wiki>
  (Home, Tools, Converter, Converter-Architecture, Known-Issues,
  Roadmap, Development, Specification, Glossary, plus `_Sidebar` /
  `_Footer`).
* `docs/` is now a Sphinx project (post-Phase-0 doc infrastructure):
  - `docs/conf.py` — Sphinx config (furo theme, myst-parser for
    Markdown source, sphinx-autoapi for auto-generated API reference
    from `src/axiomm`, intersphinx to Python/NumPy/h5py/HyperSpy,
    mathjax for formulae, sphinx-copybutton).
  - `docs/index.md` — landing page.
  - `docs/user/converter.md` — comprehensive user guide for the
    converter (canonical, repo-shipped version; the wiki Converter
    page is the GitHub-side landing).
  - `docs/user/known_issues.md` — comprehensive known-issues page.
  - `docs/Makefile` — `make html` builds to `docs/_build/html`.
  - `pyproject.toml` `[docs]` extra installs sphinx + ecosystem.
  - `.gitignore` excludes `docs/_build/` and `docs/autoapi/`.
  Build verified: `cd docs && /tmp/axiomm-venv/bin/sphinx-build -b html
  . _build/html` succeeds with 2 cosmetic warnings (docutils inline-
  literal interpretation of nested-paren strings in autoapi-rendered
  docstrings — purely visual, fixable when needed).

What does **not** yet exist (deferred to later chunks):

* `convert_many` — Chunk 6 (blocked on UX-layout decision).
* The CLI entry point — Chunk 6 (blocked on UX-layout decision).
* The `ux/` subpackage (CLI, notebook helpers, Tk dialogs) — Chunks 6/8
  (both blocked on UX-layout decision).
* True lazy execution beyond an accepted-but-downgraded `lazy=True` flag.
* The fully nested `payload.metadata["AXIOMM"]` structure suggested by
  spec §15's example (`converter` / `axes` / `source` nesting). The
  current flat `{reader, reader_version, config, provenance_classification,
  provenance, diagnostics}` layout is functionally equivalent and avoids
  a breaking change; a Phase-2 restructure can fold it into the spec's
  nested form when the public API is being broken anyway.
* The full reader/writer registry with plugin entry points — Phase 3.
* `CITATION.cff` and `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`.

### Real-file findings from Chunk 3 (recorded for later chunks)

The reader was smoke-tested against the smallest real XRM file at
`/home/francesco/Desktop/research/melts/data/Maps-HDF5/IE_30s_map__Sep16_15_20_39_A22-043_1_001.h5`
(not in the repo). Findings:

- **Counts shape** `(23, 21, 4096)` — `(xdim, ydim, n_channels)`. Reads
  cleanly; `energy_scale = 40.96 / 4096 = 0.01` keV/channel gives a
  reasonable 40.96 keV span.
- **Beam size** `"2um"` was parsed correctly → navigation scale 2.0 µm.
- **65 environ entries** were extracted without issue.
- **ROI limits shape** is `(35, 7, 2)`, *not* `(n_rois, 2)`. The real
  file stores multiple ROI variants per element (likely per-detector
  or per-fit-pass). The reader currently emits the
  `roi_limits_unexpected_shape` diagnostic and skips ROI extraction — a
  safe MVP behaviour but a real schema-conformance issue. To recover
  ROI metadata from real files, one of:
  1. Add a `roi_variant_index: int = 0` (or similar) to
     `XRMMapH5Config` in Phase 2 and use `limits[:, roi_variant_index, :]`.
  2. Use the generic HDF5 schema-driven reader (Phase 3, spec §23).

### Chunk 5 finding (recorded for future contributors)

The "no side effects" tests in `test_import_has_no_side_effects.py`
originally dropped cached `axiomm.*` modules from `sys.modules` and
re-imported them to observe import behaviour. Once enough downstream
code had been written (Chunks 3–5), those drops created **fresh class
objects** for the exception types (e.g. `OutputExistsError`) on
re-import, while older code paths (the writer, the builder) still held
references to the *original* classes. `pytest.raises(OutputExistsError)`
in test code then failed to match instances raised by the writer because
`isinstance(exc, OutputExistsError_new) == False`. The fix was to move
those tests into **subprocesses** via `_run_in_subprocess(...)` so the
import semantics are observed in true isolation, with no spillover into
the parent test session. The `_drop_axiomm_modules` helper was removed.
This is the canonical pattern for any future "test something at import
time" check in AXIOMM — don't mutate the parent process's `sys.modules`.

### Chunk 4 finding (recorded for future contributors)

HyperSpy's `axes_manager.navigation_axes` is ordered *reverse* to numpy
order within the navigation-role group. For a numpy array of shape
`(d0, d1, d2)` constructed as `hs.signals.Signal1D(data)`:

```
navigation_axes[0].index_in_array == 1   # numpy axis 1
navigation_axes[1].index_in_array == 0   # numpy axis 0
signal_axes[0].index_in_array == 2       # numpy axis 2
```

The prototype's `xrf_data.axes_manager.navigation_axes[0].name = 'x'`
therefore labelled what is actually numpy axis 1 (ydim, in our
convention) — silently swapping x and y. Our builder defends against
this by **matching `AxisSpec.index_in_array` to `hs_axis.index_in_array`
during assignment**, never relying on tuple position. The `Signal2D`
case has the same reversal within the signal-axes group.

Real-file e2e against
`IE_30s_map__Sep16_15_20_39_A22-043_1_001.h5` (data shape `(23, 21, 4096)`)
produces a `Signal1D` whose axes label correctly: `idx=0 → 'x' size=23`,
`idx=1 → 'y' size=21`, `idx=2 → 'Energy' size=4096`, with
`signal.metadata.General.title` set from the file stem and
`signal.metadata.AXIOMM.{reader,provenance,diagnostics}` populated.

## Published docs — outstanding issues

First successful GitHub Pages deploy uncovered three issues. One
fixed now, two recorded for later:

* ✅ **Dark / light logo not loading.** Furo resolves `light_logo`
  and `dark_logo` *relative to* `_static/`, so paths like
  `"../identy/AXIOMM_Design/axiomm_wave_icon.svg"` produced
  broken `_static/../identy/...` URLs on the deployed site. Fixed
  by adding `html_static_path = ["../identy/AXIOMM_Design"]` in
  `docs/conf.py` and reducing the logo / favicon entries to bare
  filenames. Sphinx now copies the identity assets into
  `_build/html/_static/` at build time, and Furo's URL rewriting
  resolves cleanly. (Local builds also copy any other files
  currently in the identity folder, but `.gitignore` keeps the
  drafts out of the CI checkout, so the deployed site stays clean.)
* ⬜ **Table of contents under Furo.** Adding a `{toctree}` to a
  page surfaces an error / mis-render under the current style.
  Not investigated this turn — needs a specific reproduction
  (which page, which directive, exact error) before a fix. Pick
  up after Phase 3 land or whenever it becomes blocking.
* ⬜ **Dark-mode is the default; user reports it should be light.**
  Furo ships a built-in dark/light toggle in the top-right; the
  initial mode follows `prefers-color-scheme` from the browser /
  OS, so this might just be system-level rather than a Furo
  default. Re-check on a system with a light-mode browser before
  changing anything; if a default-light pin is needed, Furo
  supports `default_mode` in `html_theme_options`.

## Documentation publishing

The `docs/` Sphinx project is configured to publish via two
independent hosts. Pick whichever (or both):

* **GitHub Pages** — `.github/workflows/docs.yml`. The *build* job
  runs on every push to `main`, every PR, and on manual dispatch —
  so doc regressions are caught even when nobody intends to publish.
  The *deploy* job is **opt-in via manual dispatch only**: it runs
  exclusively when you click `Actions → docs → Run workflow` on the
  main branch. This deliberately stops push-to-main runs from
  emailing "deploy failed" while Pages is unavailable (the previous
  always-deploy behaviour produced silent noise on this private
  repo). To actually publish: enable
  `Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions` (private repos need
  Pro / Team / Enterprise), then trigger the workflow manually.
* **Read the Docs** — `.readthedocs.yaml`. Sign in at
  readthedocs.org with the GitHub account and import the repo;
  RTD reads the config automatically. Public repos are free;
  private repos need an RTD subscription.

The CI build deliberately does not pass `-W` (warnings as errors)
because sphinx-autoapi's rendering of two XRMMapH5 docstrings trips
cosmetic docutils warnings; the HTML output is unaffected. Local
builds still surface them so the underlying docstring formatting
can be cleaned up when convenient.

## Next chunk: decision needed

Phase 2 is closed. From the spec's standpoint the remaining work
sits in two places, and neither is unilaterally ours to start:

**Phase 3 (spec §23) — extensibility.** Reader/writer registry with
plugin entry points, generic HDF5 schema-driven reader, additional
output formats only when scientifically justified. This is a natural
next phase and is not blocked on UX.

**UX-blocked chunks (6 and 8).** Still on hold pending Francesco's
UX-layout decision (Hybrid vs. spec-literal vs. defer further).
Implementing either of these without the decision would lock in a
namespace we may regret.

**Other plausible next moves before opening Phase 3:**

* A second post-progress wiki sweep — last one was after Chunk 5;
  per the doc-quality commitment another is overdue.
* ⛔ Domain-confirm the three scientific constants
  (`energy_scale`, `roi_limit_scale`, `fallback_field_width_um`):
  **blocked**. Francesco has asked his geology team for the
  values + scientific narrative; until that reply lands, the
  constants stay flagged as configurable assumptions in the
  `XRMMapH5Config` docstring and in the user guide's "Scientific
  assumptions still requiring owner confirmation" section. Next
  session: ask Francesco whether the team has replied; if so,
  apply the updates and lift the warning.
* ✅ Publish the Sphinx docs — set up via
  `.github/workflows/docs.yml` (GitHub Pages) and
  `.readthedocs.yaml` (Read the Docs). One manual activation step
  remains on each platform; see *Documentation publishing* above.

## Verifying the current state (after Chunk 10)

In an environment with Python ≥ 3.10 and the dev extras installed, the
canonical chunk-verification commands are:

```bash
cd /home/francesco/Desktop/research/axiomm
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,all]"
pytest -q
```

Expected result: **283 tests pass**, 0 fail. With only h5py installed
(no hyperspy): 208 pass, 5 skipped (the hspy_writer, hyperspy_builder,
workflows, and realistic-fixture regression modules skip as one unit
each; the lazy-export `test_lazy_concrete_builder_exports` skips
individually).

> Note: Francesco's `xrf` conda env has hyperspy 2.3.0 and h5py 2.10.0
> but is Python 3.9, below our declared `requires-python = ">=3.10"`,
> and lacks pytest. For dev/test runs use a Python 3.11+ environment
> with the `[dev,all]` extras installed. The author's ephemeral venv
> for this work is at `/tmp/axiomm-venv` — Python 3.11, hyperspy 2.4.0,
> h5py 3.16.0, pytest 9.0.3.

If the system pytest (`/usr/bin/pytest`, Python 3.11) is used without
installing the package, the `[tool.pytest.ini_options].pythonpath = ["src"]`
entry in `pyproject.toml` is enough — `pytest -q` from the repo root still
works.

## Open decisions

* **Licence (decided in Chunk 1).** PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 was chosen
  because Francesco said: "we do not want to release it completely free just
  now". Researchers and academic institutions can use AXIOMM freely;
  commercial users need a separate licence from Francesco. The licence is
  easy to change later (re-licensing a project still owned by a single author
  is straightforward) — if Francesco prefers a different model (BUSL,
  source-available custom, "all rights reserved"), it can swap in one
  commit. Document any change in this file and update `LICENSE` and
  `README.md` in lockstep.
* **Repository hosting.** Local-only for now. When the package is ready to
  be published, Francesco will create the GitHub repository himself and
  push from his account.
* **Package name `axiomm`.** Not yet checked against PyPI. Verify before any
  publication attempt — if taken, decide an alternative early (e.g.
  `axiomm-tools`, `pyaxiomm`) and update `pyproject.toml`,
  `README.md`, and the import root.
* **`axiomm.io` namespace.** Reserved for I/O subpackages (`converters/`
  today, possibly `formats/`, `streaming/` later). Don't put non-I/O code in
  `axiomm.io`. The broader AXIOMM analysis pipeline will live in sibling
  packages (`axiomm.signal`, `axiomm.analysis`, …) — names TBD with
  Francesco when scope expands beyond the converter.
* **UX layout (deferred by Francesco).** Spec §10 places all UX under
  `axiomm.io.converters.ux.*`. That made sense when AXIOMM ≈ the
  converter; it is less clearly right now that AXIOMM is a broader
  spectroscopy package with future tools. The three candidates are:
  (a) *Hybrid* — generic Tk and notebook helpers under `axiomm.ux.*`,
  converter-specific CLI under `axiomm.io.converters.ux.*`;
  (b) *Spec-literal* — everything under `axiomm.io.converters.ux.*`
  as written; (c) *Defer* — pick once the second AXIOMM tool's UX
  needs are visible. Francesco chose **(c) Defer**. **Do not start
  Chunks 6 or 8** until either Francesco specifies the layout or a
  second tool's needs make the right answer obvious. Chunk 7 (manifest
  + logging + provenance) is independent of UX and can proceed.
* **Documentation tooling (decided, post-Phase 0).** Two surfaces:
  (a) the **GitHub wiki** for landing pages, navigation, and quick
  orientation; (b) **Sphinx + sphinx-autoapi + furo theme + myst-parser**
  in `docs/` for the canonical user guide and the auto-generated Python
  API reference. Both are maintained for now; once the API stabilises
  (Phase 2+) and the Sphinx HTML is published (GitHub Pages or RTD),
  the wiki pages can shrink and point at the published docs. Build
  locally with `cd docs && make html`. Install the build toolchain via
  `pip install -e ".[docs]"`.

## Notes for resuming work

* If `pyproject.toml` was edited to add the CLI entry point earlier than
  Chunk 6, revert — the chunk plan keeps things working in order.
* The synthetic HDF5 fixture in Chunk 3 should live at
  `tests/io/converters/fixtures.py` and produce a `(4, 3, 16)` array per
  spec §20.1.
* When implementing Chunk 4 (HyperSpy builder), use the real
  `IE_30s_map__Sep16_15_20_39_A22-043_1_001.h5` at
  `/home/francesco/Desktop/research/melts/data/Maps-HDF5/` (≈ 950 KB,
  smallest available) to verify axis order matches the prototype's output.
  Do **not** commit that file or any other real `.h5` to the repo.
